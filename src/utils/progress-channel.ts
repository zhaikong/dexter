/**
 * Create a progress channel that bridges synchronous `emit()` calls
 * from inside a tool to the async generator that the agent drains.
 *
 * Uses a simple buffer + pending-resolver pattern:
 * - If the consumer is waiting (no buffered items), `emit()` resolves
 *   the pending promise immediately.
 * - If the consumer is busy, messages buffer until the next `next()` call.
 * - `close()` marks the channel as done; the iterator terminates after
 *   draining any remaining buffered items.
