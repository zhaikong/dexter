   - Key data points, numbers, and findings returned

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Original Query and Intent: The user's exact request and what they are trying to learn or accomplish.
2. Key Concepts: Important tickers, companies, sectors, financial metrics, or technical concepts involved.
3. Data Retrieved: For each tool call, summarize the tool name, arguments, and key results. Preserve important data points.
4. Errors and Retries: Any tool failures, empty results, or retried calls and their outcomes.
5. Analysis Progress: What has been analyzed so far, what conclusions or comparisons have been reached.
6. Numerical Data: ALL key numbers retrieved — prices, revenue figures, margins, ratios, growth rates, estimates, dates. This section is critical; do not omit any numbers that were returned by tools.
7. Pending Data Needs: What data has NOT yet been retrieved that would be needed to fully answer the query.
8. Current Work State: What was being worked on when this summary was requested.
9. Recommended Next Steps: What tool calls or analysis should happen next to complete the answer.

Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

<example>
<analysis>
[Your thought process, ensuring all numerical data and findings are captured accurately]
</analysis>

<summary>
1. Original Query and Intent:
   [Detailed description of what the user asked]

2. Key Concepts:
   - [Ticker/concept 1]
   - [Ticker/concept 2]

3. Data Retrieved:
   - [tool_name(args)]: [Key findings and data points]
   - [tool_name(args)]: [Key findings and data points]

4. Errors and Retries:
   - [Error description and resolution, or "None"]

5. Analysis Progress:
   [What has been analyzed, comparisons made, conclusions reached]

6. Numerical Data:
   - [Ticker/metric]: [value] ([date/period])
   - [Ticker/metric]: [value] ([date/period])

7. Pending Data Needs:
   - [Data still needed]

8. Current Work State:
   [What was being worked on]

9. Recommended Next Steps:
   [Next actions to take]
